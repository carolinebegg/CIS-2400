# CIS 2400: Introduction to Computer Systems

## Course Description
_You know how to program, but do you know how computers really work? How do millions of transistors come together to form a complete computing system? This bottom-up course begins with transistors and simple computer hardware structures, continues with low-level programming using primitive machine instructions, and finishes with an introduction to the C programming language. This course is a broad introduction to all aspects of computer systems architecture and serves as the foundation for subsequent computer systems courses, such as Computer Organization and Design (CIS 4710), Computer Operating Systems (CIS 3800), and Compilers and Interpreters (CIS 3410)._
